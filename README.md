# DexHandControl Library

This DexHandControl library is developed based on a UDP communication framework. Below are the configuration and usage instructions:

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions
#### 📌 Step 0 : Network Requirements 🌐

1. **Frequency Band**  
   - ✅ **Must be 2.4GHz**  
   - ❌ 5GHz networks are **not supported** (ESP32 only support 2.4GHz)

2. **Security Protocol**  
   - 🔒 **WPA2-PSK (AES)** required  
   - ⚠️ Avoid: WEP/WPA(TKIP)/Open networks


#### 📌 Step 1 : Flash ESP32 Firmware 💾
1. Navigate to `DHandControl/BusServoDriverHAT` Arduino project  
2. Update the following configurations in the `UDP.h` file:

```cpp
// WIFI_STA settings
const char* STA_SSID = "Shuteng";
const char* STA_PWD  = "12345678";

WiFiUDP Udp;
const int udpPort = 12345; // Port number for UDP communication
IPAddress local_ip(192, 168, 4, 5); // Static local IP   
IPAddress gateway(192, 168, 4, 1); // AP gateway    
IPAddress subnet(255, 255, 255, 0);
```
> `STA_SSID` and `STA_PWD`: These represent the WiFi network name and password that the ESP32 will connect to.  
> `gateway`: This is the gateway address of the local network access point (AP).  
> `local_ip`: Defines the static IP address of the ESP32 within this local network.  
> `udpPort`: Specifies the port number used for establishing UDP communication.  
3. Upload to ESP32

#### 📌 Step 2 : PC Network Setup 💻
1. Connect your PC to the same WiFi network specified in `STA_SSID` to ensure both the dexterous hand and your PC are on the same local network.
2. Also check the network **Frequency Band** and **Security Protocol** here, must be **2.4Ghz** && **WPA2**.  
3. Configure your PC's IPv4 address within this local network to match the `pc_ip` setting in `DHandControl/scripts/main_udp.py`:
```python
def __init__(self, hand_ip="192.168.4.5", pc_ip="192.168.4.10", udp_port=12345):
```
> ⚠️Ensure this IP address is:  
> Within the same subnet as the ESP32 (`192.168.4.x`)  
> Not conflicting with other devices on the network  
> Different from the ESP32's `local_ip` (`192.168.4.5`)
